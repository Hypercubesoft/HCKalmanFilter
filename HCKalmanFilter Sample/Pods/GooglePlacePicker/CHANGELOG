==========================

    be turned down on July 31, 2019, and will no longer be available or
    supported after that date.
  - Support for iOS 8.0 has been dropped. The new minimum is iOS 9.0.

Version 2.4.0 - August 2017
===========================
Note:
  - The armv7s architecture in the frameworks has been removed. Devices which
    previously used armv7s are still supported using the armv7 architecture.
    All applications using the default architecture settings in any supported
    version of Xcode should not notice any change.
  - The layout of the static frameworks has changed. There is no longer a
    Versions directory. The contents of Versions/A has been moved to the root
    directory of the framework. Developers who manually integrate frameworks
    with their project should take additional care during the upgrade.
  - Support for Xcode 7.3 will be dropped with 2.5.0.

Version 2.3.1 - June 2017
========================
Note:
  - Updated for compatibility with GoogleMaps/GooglePlaces 2.3.1

Version 2.3.0 - May 2017
========================
Features:
  - Expanded the number of scenarios where you can use the place picker with the
    addition of GMSPlacePickerViewController. The old GMSPlacePicker is now
    deprecated.

Improvements:
  - Dropped support for iOS 7, which enabled the use of modern core data
    threading models. This means that applications should be able to use
    -com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1 when debugging with iOS 10 devices.

Note:
  - The armv7s architecture in the frameworks will be removed in 2.4. Devices
    which previously used armv7s can continue to be supported using the armv7
    architecture. All applications using the default architecture settings
    in any supported version of Xcode shouldn't notice any change.

Version 2.2.0 - February 2017
=============================
Resolved Issues:
  - Fixes an issue where the Place Picker viewport was not being centered
    correctly.

Note:

    the last release series to support iOS 7.

    domain and codes.
  - Small fixes to RTL support in the place picker.
  - Minor reliability improvements for the autocomplete widget and place picker.

Version 2.0.1 - July 2016
=========================

Resolved Issues:
  - Array properties are now correctly typed when accessed from Swift.

Version 2.0.0 - July 2016
=========================

Improvements:
  ! This release splits the Places API from the Maps SDK. Previously, if you
    wanted to use the Places API you had to include all of GoogleMaps. As a
    result of the split, the final size of the Places API binary is 70% smaller
    than the previous combined binary. If you are using only the Maps SDK you
    will not be affected unless you have pinned your dependency on GoogleMaps
    to a version earlier than 2.0. In this case, you should update this
    restriction in your Podfile. If you are using the Places API, see the
    migration guide online for more details.

Resolved Issues:
  - The Places framework is now available as a download for manual installation.
    For details, see the get started guide online.
  - The Places API no longer requests permission to access the user's location
    on behalf of the app. This means that existing code which calls
    GMSPlacesClient.currentPlaceWithCallback(_:) must be updated to ensure that
    the location permission has been granted beforehand.
